# Custom Scripting Language (TypeScript Implementation)

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a custom scripting language implemented in TypeScript. The language is designed to be simple and flexible, enabling users to define and execute scripts for various tasks. The primary goal of this project is to showcase the implementation of a scripting engine, which could serve as a foundation for creating more complex scripting languages.
- **Deployment Link**: Added the clickable deployment link `[Custom Language Interpreter](https://custom-language-interpreter.vercel.app/)` in the "Deployment" section.

## Features

- **Custom Syntax**: A tailored syntax to execute commands and define logic.
- **Execution Engine**: A parser and interpreter that processes scripts written in the custom language.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to extend the language with additional features or commands.
- **Integration**: Can be integrated into JavaScript/TypeScript-based applications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
